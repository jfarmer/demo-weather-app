## API Key

```

## Plan

1. Display temp of hard-coded location
2. Display temperature of current location
3. Get current location (how?)
4. Maybe let user enter zip code or location?
5. Get temperature from current location (probably from a weather API)


## What's left to figure out?

1. Get data from API while on website
1. Take that data and put it in page somehow
